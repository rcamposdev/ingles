### Read the article

Paddleboarding is a mixture of two water sports - surfing and **rowing**. Paddleboarding uses a **surfboard** and the paddleboarder 'rows' the board. However, there are two big differences. In surfing, you have to **stand**, but in paddleboarding you can **kneel** or **lie** on the **board**. In rowing you use **oars**, but in paddleboarding you mustn't use oars. You have to use your **arms** to move along.


You can do the sport on rivers, but most of the big competitions are on the ocean. The main competition for paddleboarders is the annual race from Molokai to Oahu in Hawaii. The distance is 50 kilometres. On a good day, with the right kind of waves, you don't always have to use your arms because the water carries you some of the way but, no a bad day, you are using your arms the **whole way**.


Competitors must be very **strong** and athletic. One of paddleboarding's most famous competitors is the Australian Jamie Mitchell. Not many people know about Mitchell, but he is the eight-time winner of the Molokai to Oahu race.  He also has the record time of four hours, fifty-eight minutes and twenty-five seconds.


**Because the sport isn't well known**, the prize money for winning paddleboarding is small compared to other sports - Mitchell only received $3,000 for winning the race this year. But Mitchell obviously loves the sport because he trains two or three times a day, six days a week, for the four months before the race. At the same time, he has to earn money, so he does anything including working in bars or building work. 


So how does Mitchell stay interested in such a sport? He says, 'I just love paddleboarding. It's not about winning. It's about coming to Hawai and spending time with my good friends in a place that I love.'
