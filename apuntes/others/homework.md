Globally, more people play football than any other sport, and more people watch the World Cup on TV than the Olympic Games. Every weekend, thousands of teams meet in different countries to compete against each other. That includes famous teams such as Real Madrid and Manchester United, and local teams of people playing competitively and for fun. From an early age, school children play football in their physical education lessons and compete against teams from other schools. Now, there is new type of football which is growing in popularity. It's called 'walking football". 


Most footballers retire from competitive games in their thirties, but walking football is for the over fifties. It's a great way to keep fit and it can help older people live longer. Doctors also say it's good for the mind and relaxation. Most walking football matches are informal and social. Most of the rules are the same as for normal football, but everything is much slower. Players have to walk with the ball - they can't run. Also, players have to keep one foot on the ground all the time so they can't jump. 


Not surprisingly, walking football doesn't get many spectators because it is very slow. But more and more people like playing it; for example, in the United Kingdom there were around 100 teams two years ago. Now there are over 800, with regular competitions in different parts of the country every year.


## Bolivian Wrestlers

### Read the article

**In Bolivia, football is the country's national sport but the country is also famous for another sport-wrestling. Local people like watching the wrestling and it's very popular with tourists. It's an exciting mixture of sport, drama and entertainment. When modern wrestling started in Bolivia in the 1950s, the competitors were all men, but nowadays women are also competing in the ring.**

The city of El Alto is a good place to watch the wrestling. Hundreds of spectators go to the fights in the evening. This evening, the crowd is sitting round a huge wrestling ring and they shout: 'Bring them on! Bring them on!' Suddenly, the commentator is speaking into a microphone: 'Ladies and Gentlemen. It's time for Yolanda and Claudina!' The crowd is screaming with excitement as two women in colourful clothes enter the ring. 

Yolanda and Claudina are like famous pop stars. They smile and wave to their fans. The music stops and the referee starts the fight. Claudina jumps on Yolanda. Then Yolanda throws Claudina on the floor. As Claudina lies on the floor, Yolanda smiles and waves to the crowd. Then, Claudina gets up and pushes Yolanda onto the ground. One minute Yolanda is winning. The next minute, Claudina is winning. The spectators go crazy! 

Away from the ring, many wrestlers are women with families. At home Yolanda has a normal and quiet family life. She has two daughters and she makes clothes for a living. Her father was also a wrestler, so it's a family tradition. In answer to the question, 'Would your daughters like to become wrestlers one day?' Yolanda says they wouldn't. She answers: 'My daughters ask me why I do this. It's dangerous and they complain that wrestling doesn't bring any money into the house.' So why does she do it? 

Yolanda loves wrestling because of her fans, and she has lots of them. One of her fans is called Esperanza Cancina. She pays $1.50 (a large part of her salary) to sit near the ring. Esperanza likes watching the wrestling because she says: "We laugh and we forget our problems for three or four hours."

### Read the article

Paddleboarding is a mixture of two water sports - surfing and **rowing**. Paddleboarding uses a **surfboard** and the paddleboarder 'rows' the board. However, there are two big differences. In surfing, you have to **stand**, but in paddleboarding you can **kneel** or **lie** on the **board**. In rowing you use **oars**, but in paddleboarding you mustn't use oars. You have to use your **arms** to move along.


You can do the sport on rivers, but most of the big competitions are on the ocean. The main competition for paddleboarders is the annual race from Molokai to Oahu in Hawaii. The distance is 50 kilometres. On a good day, with the right kind of waves, you don't always have to use your arms because the water carries you some of the way but, no a bad day, you are using your arms the **whole way**.


Competitors must be very **strong** and athletic. One of paddleboarding's most famous competitors is the Australian Jamie Mitchell. Not many people know about Mitchell, but he is the eight-time winner of the Molokai to Oahu race.  He also has the record time of four hours, fifty-eight minutes and twenty-five seconds.


**Because the sport isn't well known**, the prize money for winning paddleboarding is small compared to other sports - Mitchell only received $3,000 for winning the race this year. But Mitchell obviously loves the sport because he trains two or three times a day, six days a week, for the four months before the race. At the same time, he has to earn money, so he does anything including working in bars or building work. 


So how does Mitchell stay interested in such a sport? He says, 'I just love paddleboarding. It's not about winning. It's about coming to Hawai and spending time with my good friends in a place that I love.'
