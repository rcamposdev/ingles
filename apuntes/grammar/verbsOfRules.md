## üìù Use

To talk about **rules**, we use the verbs must, have to and can. 

- To say that something is **obligatory**, we use must or have to. 

	- You have to train hard to do a Marathon. 
	- Runners must arrive twenty minutes before the race. 


- To say that something is **allowed**, we use can. 

    - Members can use the swimming pool for free. 

- To say that something is **not obligatory but allowed**, we use don't have to. 

    - You don't have to be fit to join the club. 

- To say that something is **not allowed**, we use can't or mustn't. 

    - You can't touch the ball in football. 
    - You mustn't leave any bags in this area. 

The verbs must and have to, and can't and mustn't, have very similar meanings. 

In general, we prefer to use have to and can't in SPOKEN English to talk about rules. In formal, WRITTEN English, we prefer to use must and mustn't. 

- You have to pay $40 to do the race. (spoken) 
- Competitors must pay $40 to enter the race. (formal, written) 
- You can't go near the pool with shoes on. (spoken) 
- Customers must not go near the pool with shoes on. (formal, written) 

But remember that mustn't and don't have to have completely different meanings - mustn't means 'don't do it!', while don't have to means 'it's not necessary to do it'.
